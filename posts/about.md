Hi, I'm Pat ðŸ‘‹. I'm a software engineer.
<br>

Most of my time at work and at home is spent writing code or learning about
writing code. I also _really_ like keyboards. I soldered my first mechanical
keyboard together on my own. Then 6 months later I accidentally ripped the USB
out of it ðŸ¤¦. Now I am using an Ergodox EZ and it has been great. 

I like to work on open source projects. I have a handful of stuff you probably
won't find useful on my Github and I've been participating in Hacktoberfest
since its second year.

I don't have a lot of experience blogging but hopefully that will change soon. ðŸ˜‰
